2025/08/05 18:42:28 WARNING mlflow.models.signature: Failed to infer the model signature from the input example. Reason: MlflowException("Unable to map 'object' type to MLflow DataType. object can be mapped iff all values have identical data type which is one of (string, (bytes or byterray),  int, float)."). To see the full traceback, set the logging level to DEBUG via `logging.getLogger("mlflow").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`. To disable automatic signature inference, set `signature` to `False` in your `log_model` or `save_model` call.
